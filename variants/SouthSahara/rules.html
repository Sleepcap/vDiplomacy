<p><b>Rules:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Play starts in Spring 1401.</li>
<li>Victory consists of the ownership of 13 Supply Centers (a majority of the 25 Supply Centers).</li>
<li>Powers may build in any vacant Supply Center they own.</li>
<li>The Sahara and Ocean areas are not provinces and may not themselves be occupied, as they are merely indicators of adjacency. There are 5 "oasis" provinces within the Sahara area and 3 "high seas" provinces within the Ocean area. Those provinces may be occupied in the same manner as any other land or sea province and function in the same way. Each such province is adjacent to a) all of the other provinces of its type, and b) all of the provinces visibly adjacent to the area in which it is located. For example, Oa1 is adjacent to Oa2, Oa3, Oa4, Oa5, Tibesti, Murzuk, Ghat, Tavdeni, Tichitt and Akjouti.</li>
