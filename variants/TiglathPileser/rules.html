<p><b>Background:</b></p>
<ol>
Since the early days of the Iron Age, Assyria with its fearsome army has been the dominant force in Mesopotamia and Syria, conquering many lands to satisfy the god Assur. By 745 BC, however, this era of supremacy has come to a crashing halt. New and old powers are rising to stake their claim. 

<p>The young nation of Urartu, with its mountain fortresses, has enjoyed victories over the once invincible Assyrian army and King Sarduri II is already proclaiming himself king of the universe.<p>

<p> Babylon, defiantly independent and ever rebellious against Assyrian rule, once again enjoys native rule under Nabonassar. Though in a precarious situation, the new king seeks to unite the fragile country and return to the city of Marduk her empire and status as the greatest city in the world.<p>

 <p>The enigmatic civilization of Elam, once disappeared from the historical record, has returned with a vengeance. Humban-Tahrah and his son Humban-Nikash seek to thwart Assyrian and Babylonian ambitions while extending their domain across Mesopotamia, as previous Elamite kings did centuries ago.<p> 
 <p>Egypt under Shoshenq V sits in a sad state, disintegrated into rival chiefdoms and principalities. However, a powerful ruler...or a powerful outside threat...could unite the country into  the powerhouse it was during the New Kingdom.<p>
 <p>The Kingdom of Kush is one such threat to Egyptian self-rule. Prince Piye, son of Kashta, is said to have the daring ambition of taking Kush from former Egyptian subject to the new masters of the Nile. Surely, after becoming sole pharaoh, his conquests will not stop there.<p>

<p>Then, there is Phrygia of King Midas, whose spectacular wealth is more than myth. Once a band of migrating tribes, this nation is set to use its newfound power to impose its influence over the petty neo-Hittite kingdoms of Anatolia and beyond. <p>

<p>Meanwhile, to the far south, the kingdom of Saba' (also known as Sheba), renowned for its spectacular wealth is consolidating its control over the invaluable caravan trade that the kingdom to the rest of the world. This trade empire will soon become a military one as it stretches across the incense roots, creating a Sabaean monopoly. 

<p>

<p>Certainly the usurper Pulu, now King Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, would seem to have an impossible task ahead of him. However, the former general has ended incessant civil wars and has his eyes set upon conquering the greatest empire the world has ever seen. And, as we know, the god Assur favors those who conquer in his name.<p>

<p><b>Rules and Features:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Standard rules apply, along with build anywhere.</li>
<li><b>Land Bridges:</b> Seven land bridge connections exist marked by maroon curves joining two land regions separated by sea. These directly connect the two regions and can be traveled by army or fleet.</li>
<li><b>Navigable Rivers:</b>If a land region borders a light blue large river, this indicates the region is a coastal region and navies can travel through these regions. If the region borders two rivers or a sea coastline and a river, then the two separate coasts are marked, west (wc) and east (ec) or south (sc) and north (nc), and navies cannot travel directly between different coasts. Rivers <b>DO NOT</b> inhibit movement between adjacent regions. Armies and navies can cross all rivers. </li>

<li><b>Pharaonic Canal:</b> The Tanis region contains the only canal in the game. So, a navy can travel Sea of Philistia to Tanis to Straits of Tiran and vice versa.</li>
<li>Dark brown areas are impassible land and only fill space on the map.</li>

<li>Dark blue areas are impassible water and only serve an aesthetic purpose. </ol>
