<p><b>About 1913:</b></p>

<p><b>'1913'</b> takes place just after the Second Balkan War, as the powderkeg of Europe approaches its decisive point. Inspired by Stephen Agar's 'Diplomacy II', Baron Powell's '1900', airborne's 'Abstraction III' and John Norris' 'Milan', <b>'1913'</b> tries to balance out the Classic board dynamics while keeping its simplicity and providing a more historical setup than that of Allan Calhamer's original map.</p>

<p><b>AUSTRIA</b> lies in a crossroads between east and west, capable of marching into either direction while also suffering dangerous threats from all sides. Its ambitions in the wealthy Balkans will be challenged by Russians, Italians and Turks willing to expand at Austria's expense, but a wise Archduke can build a web of alliances that matches those of the great Habsburgs of old. Meanwhile in Central Europe, Austrian intervention may be the ultimate factor in deciding the fates of Italy, Germany and France - a power that can be used to great profit.</p>

<p><b>ENGLAND</b> has been conducting the Concert of Europe for almost a century, but its supremacy is put under check by envious neighbors wanting their own place in the sun. Scandinavia  is a mighty prize in the Prime Minister's sights, but the Low Countries are just as important: an enemy there effectively holds a gun pointed at England's heart. Both Germany and Russia are keen to prove they are England's lackeys no more, while France still does not forget its past losses against English power - the combined might of these empires may signify the end of England's own glory. In the distant east, Egypt is held under threat from Turkish irredentists and Italian imperialists, yet the distant garrison may prove essential in settling any Eastern wars that may arise - where England can earn its due.</p>

<p><b>FRANCE</b> is the solitary light in a world about to fall in absolute darkness. The Low Countries are squarely within French interests, but control of the area escapes the President's grasp. The Iberian Peninsula holds great respect for French culture and power, and if convinced to join France's sphere of influence the Iberians can help fulfill greater dreams of conquest. The use of Algeria's resources is a dilemma: should it reinforce the French heartland against German, English and Italian claims, or start an offensive against the rebels ruling Lybia? Since France is surrounded by all sides, energetic diplomacy will be needed to maintain the splendour of its glorious mainlaind and rich African empire.</p>

<p><b>GERMANY</b> is a rising star in the constellation of Europa; its military capacity, economic means and political ambition are second to none. Germany has the Low Countries held firmly by its experienced, battle-hardened army, and Scandinavia holds even greater opportunities for a cunning Kaiser, but will it be enough? Eyes must be put upon the democracies to the west and the old empires to the east, as Germany is right in the middle of them all, holding the unique potential - and some whisper, birthright - to guide the Great Powers with an iron fist as in the days of Bismarck.</p>

<p><b>ITALY</b> is an island that happens to be connected to the continent; its true home is the Mediterranean, a fact the King of Italy knows well. To the north, expanding its sphere of influence over Switzerland may open up new opportunities against either France or Germany; to the east the Balkans lie in disarray, awaiting its rightful master to arrive and put an end to endless war and anarchy; to the south lies Lybia, recently taken away from the Turks but not truly conquered, as the locals quickly erupted in rebellion. No matter the King's decision, Italy's path will undoubtedly shake the foundations of Europe.</p>

<p><b>RUSSIA</b> is vast, but such power comes at a price: its borders are long and hard to defend, while its main spheres of interest, Scandinavia and the Balkans, are under the ambitious gaze of lesser nations. The Tsar leads an empire capable of steamrolling the eastern marches, but negotiation will have to come to the forefront if a costly two-front war is to be avoided. As the bear's shadow falls upon the continent, a choice will have to be made: will the armies of Russia march north, towards German and English interests in the Atlantic, or will they go south, where old claims over the Balkan Peninsula bind Austria and Turkey together?</p>

<p><b>TURKEY</b> might be the Sick Man of Europe, but what is more dangerous than an old enemy with little left to lose? The Sultan will need to reorganize the empire's defenses and plan alliances in advance: can the Russians be trusted after spilling so much Turkish blood? Austria may offer goodwill, but the clash of titans over the Balkans in the past centuries may be proof that any cooperation will not last long. Italy is a fellow power willing to go through great distances to prove the worth of its place in the Concert, but their recent attack on Lybia means they will not stop until complete mastery of the Mediterranean is theirs. England occupies Egypt, by right belonging to the Ottomans, yet help can be received from them - or even more war. The empire has lasted for six hundred years, and under a wise ruler it shall endure much more.</p>

<ol>
<li>Ruhr is renamed Cologne, Tunis is renamed Tunisia, Bulgaria's East Coast is renamed North Coast, and Venice is renamed Venetia.</li>

<li>Two new spaces are created from North Africa, Morocco and Algeria. Algeria is a French supply center, while Tunisia is no longer a supply center.</li>
<li>Switzerland becomes a neutral supply center; the Tyrrhenian Sea is extended to reach Algeria, and Rome is extended to annex Tuscany.</li>
<li>Three new spaces are added between North Africa and Syria, called Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Egypt. Tripolitania is a neutral supply center, while Egypt is an English supply center.</li>
<li>Movement is allowed between Morocco and Spain, and between Egypt and North Atlantic Ocean.</li>
<li>England has a fleet in Egypt; France has an army in Algeria; Germany has an army in Cologne.</li>
<li>Algeria and Egypt, being colonies, cannot build units.</li>
