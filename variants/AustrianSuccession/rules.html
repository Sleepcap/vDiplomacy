			<h2>Historical Background</h2>
			<p>
			The War of Austrian Succession was nothing short of a struggle for control of the Holy Roman Empire itself. The Habsburg monarchy, whose line of succession had fallen to Maria Theresa, the Archduchess of Austria, now faced the challenge of Frederick II of Prussia, who claimed that Salic Law forbid a woman from taking the throne.
			<br>
			<br>
			Joining Prussia historically were the Kingdom of France and Electorate of Bavaria, who chafed under the Habsburg rule. At the same time, Great Britain and Piedmont-Sardinia rallied to the fledgling Holy Roman Empress' cause. In the ensuing chaos, Spain saw an opportunity to reclaim its European holdings, while Russia and the Ottoman Empire lurked in the background.

			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Some powers start with "empty" provinces: ones that have a supply center, but do not start with a unit. Once the game begins, however, they can be built upon like any normal province. See the table below to reference individual powers.</li>
				<li>The map contains a few small, unnamed provinces that are only intended to enhance the map's visuals. While they may seem to "belong" to other, named provinces, they have no bearing on adjacency.</li>
				<li>Croatia - Dalmatia Borders: Note that Croatia borders both Dalmatia AND the Adriatic Sea. Meanwhile, Dalmatia Simultaneously borders Carinthia, Croatia, and Bosnia.</li>
				<li>Territory "Connectors:" There are two kinds of connectors present on the small map; the large, curved ones represent connections between territories that take place off the map, while the small, straight ones indicate "land bridges" between two territories separated by a small body of water (this means both armies and fleets can move freely between them). The larger connectors are not present on the big map because it is large enough to show the boders to the North and East which are beyond the edge of the small map.</li>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Austria</b></td>
					<td>Vienna(A), Budapest(A), Croatia(A), Silesia(X), Milan(X)</td>
					<td>
						Loyal to its Archduchess Maria Theresa, the new Holy Roman Empress, Austria must struggle to rally its military to defend its vast holdings against the sudden onslaught it faces from opposing nations and defend the Habsburg name. Strong foreign relations and cunning diplomacy will be needed to ensure that the territories of Milan and Silesia survive the first year.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Bavaria</b></td>
					<td>Munich(A), Regensburg(A), Churchlands(X)</td>
					<td>
						Seeming small and insignificant at first glance, the Electorate of Bavaria resides not only in the heart of the Continent, but the Holy Roman Empire itself. Bavaria must leverage its unique position to carve out a new Kingdom with the riches of central Europe and influence the actions of its larger neighbors. An enterprising Bavarian autocrat might even recognize that the Bavarian-controlled Churchlands are the prime location for the construction of a port, if they can be protected from its neighbors long enough to realize such a plan.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>England</b></td>
					<td>London(F), Bristol(A), Scotland(F), Ireland(X)</td>
					<td>
						England has always been rich and powerful, with equally powerful enemies, yet its unique status as an island nation will give it an edge in the upcoming war. Though this mighty Kingdom's full glove-spanning strength may be diluted by its many interests in the colonies, its ample fleets on the home front remain a force to be reckoned with along the coasts of Europe.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>France</b></td>
					<td>Brest(F), Bordeaux(A), Rouen(A), Paris(X)</td>
					<td>
						Perhaps the mightiest and wealthiest single Kingdom in all Europe, France has much to gain from this tipping point in the balance of power. Its large, well-supplied standing armies give it the means with which to achieve its ambitions. As the war begins, conscription has not even needed to begin in Paris, where a sense of security still reigns.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Ottoman Empire</b></td>
					<td>Constantinople(A), Bulgaria(A), Greece(A)</td>
					<td>
						The hulking monolith of the Ottoman Empire has no real bone to pick in this matter of succession. Yet, when you are one of the greatest powers of the world, why not put these squabbling Europeans in their place once in a while? Austria and Russia have been quite annoying these past few years, after all. All it would take for the Ottomans to enter the fray would be a little incentive from one of the warring western nations... Or perhaps just the riches of the now-contested Mediterranean would be enough.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Piedmont-Sardinia</b></td>
					<td>Piedmont(F), Sardinia(A), Savoy(A)</td>
					<td>
						The Alliance of Piedmont-Sardinia must be quick to respond to the machinations of its newly awakened neighbor, Spain, and assert the dominance of the Mediterranean that is its by right. Meanwhile, a choice is to be had on the Italian Peninsula. Should the holdings of others be honored, or have times changed? Whatever the descision, Piedmont-Sardinia must act decisively before their neighbor's troops have time to mobilize if they are to take advantage of the situation.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Prussia</b></td>
					<td>Berlin(A), Stettin(A), East Prussia(X)</td>
					<td>
						While small, Prussia boasts one of the hardest and most professional fighting forces in the world. Ready to initate the war with a surprise attack, Frederick II has grouped his armies in his western holdings, just a short march from conquests that will allow Prussia to rise to its rightful status as the preminent European power.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Russia</b></td>
					<td>St.Petersburg(F), Moscow(A), Kiev(A)</td>
					<td>
						Vast and Foreboding, Russia has just concluded a war with the Ottoman Empire and is ready to rembroil itself in in European politics once more. With some access to the Black Sea finally attained, Russia can flex its muscles on a large number of fronts, making it a versatile ally and an unpredicatble enemy.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td style="font-size:100%;"><b>Spain</b></td>
					<td>Madrid(A), Seville(A), Valencia(F)</td>
					<td>
						As war breaks out, Spain sees an opening to reclaim its lost holdings in northern Italy and the rest of Europe. It must rush to ready its troops in Naples to take back what it once rightfully ruled... before the surrounding violence relieves it of its Italian holdings altogether. Meanwhile, the rich Mediterranean coasts offer many temptations, and the chance to increase Spain's power.
