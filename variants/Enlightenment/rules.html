<p><b>Succession and Enlightenment:</b></p>

<p>Europe is on the verge of being aflame. In the East the
succession of the new King Charles XII of Sweden is being watched closely by
her neighbors. It is very possible that war will break out to decide the next
supreme power of the East. In the West, Charles II finally meets God leaving
Spain is a state of chaos where Spanish possessions out of the heartland has
taken their opportunity to gain more freedom from Spain. The great powers of
Europe circle around like vultures. The proud Ottomans once the terrorizer of
Europe is still reeling from the events of 1683, their empire crumbling all but
name, only the heartland of the Empire under the Sultan&apos;s direct rule and the rest 
of the empire gaining more and more autonomy. Venice however is on a slight revival 
with defeating of the Turks in <strong>Morean</strong> War. It may be possible for 
Venice to reclaim a great empire. Yet in all of the tensions and conflict of Europe there is still
the growth of science, philosophy, art, and music Enlightenment. Europe is
ripe for great change. Diplomats and generals, play your music.</p>
