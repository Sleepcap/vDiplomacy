<p>The normal rules of Diplomacy apply except as amended below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clyde, Wales, and Yorkshire are home supply centers for England (in addition to London, Liverpool, and Edinburgh).</li>

<li>England begins the game with an army located in each of its six home supply centers. For any English unit to leave the home island, it must be convoyed by a foreign fleet.</li>

<li>Due to the additional three supply centers, the victory condition is nineteen (19) centers.</li>
