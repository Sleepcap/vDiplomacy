<ul><li>Mods &amp; admins take a relaxed approach to rule enforcement based on mutual respect for other players.</li>
<li>Mods &amp; admins keep an objective view when they have to enforce rules.</li>
<li>Mods &amp; admins give the benefit of the doubt to a reasonable degree.</li>

<ul><li>Use common sense and respect other players.</li>
<li>Help the mods &amp; admins keep our server fun.</li>

<a name="Rules"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/alert.png" alt=" " /> Rules:</h3>

<a name="Mods"></a><h4>1. Do not use the software or moderators as a diplomacy tactic</h4>
<p>
  Lying is fine in Diplomacy <em>except when it gives mods/admins unnecessary work to do!</em><br /><br />
</p>

<h4><a name="Spam"></a>2. Do not spam the forum or private messaging system</h4>
<p>
  You are welcome and indeed encouraged to join in with the community but be sensible.&nbsp; Try to keep replies relevant to the conversation and don't start too many threads at once. Before posting a question relating to the software please read the <a href="faq.php" class="light">FAQ</a>.
</p>

<a name="Answer"></a><h4>3. You must answer communication from site staff</h4>
<p>
  You must answer any warnings or other messages sent to you by the moderators, because if you don't reply it will be assumed you have something to hide, and your account may be closed.&nbsp; As part of this, you <em>must make sure</em> that the email address provided is one you still check, because this normally how staff will communicate with you.
</p>

<a name="CommonSense"></a><h4>4. Follow common sense</h4>
<p>
  The rules above are mainly ones which might not be obvious; just because a specific rule isn't given here doesn't mean
  moderators can't stop people ruining the server for others!

<a name="silenceInfo"></a><h3><img src="images/icons/unmute.png" alt=" " title="An icon indicating someone isn't muted; use this to mute people" /> Forum moderation:</h3>

<h4><img src="images/icons/mute.png" alt=" " title="An icon indicating someone is muted; use this to unmute people" /> Self-moderation:</h4>
<p>
A user-driven approach is generally taken to forum moderation;
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can <em>mute any other user</em> which you don't want to see in the forum or get PMs from.</li>
<li>You can <em>mute any forum thread</em> you aren't interested in.</li>
<li>You can <em>mute any country</em> playing in a game with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This allows you to block out anyone or any discussion you find offensive, and be as open or
restrictive in what you see as you like!
</p>

<h4><img src="images/icons/lock.png" alt=" " /> Site-moderation:</h4>
<p>
Rarely self-moderation isn't enough; e.g. threads which share information on a 
<em>private / anonymous / gunboat game</em>, or threads about 
<em>suspected multi-accounters / meta-gamers / bugs</em>.
<br /><br />
These have a negative impact on games which self-moderation can't prevent, so the 
mod team can <em>lock/silence</em> these threads:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Silences can apply to a <em>user or a thread</em>.</li>
<li>The details can be viewed on the forum page, when the "New thread" button is pressed.</li>
<li>Thread silences last indefinitely, but user silences expire after a brief <em>cool-off period</em>.</li>
<li>Silenced threads / users can <em>still be viewed</em>, however no more messages may be posted.</li>
<li>Silenced users can <em>still play in games</em>; it affects the forum only.</li>
</ul>

<p>

Remember that mods will only silence users / threads when there has been a <em>clear rule violation</em>, as
a <em>last resort</em>.<br />
If it's a <em>first time mistake</em>, and you inform the mods that you won't repeat it, they will probably
be happy to <em>reduce your cool-off period</em>!<br /><br />

Don't create new accounts to work around user silences, or post threads to continue on from 
ones which have been silenced! This may result in bans etc, which would be worse than simply 
keeping off the forum for a few days.
<br /><br />

Thanks for helping keep the forum from negatively impacting peoples' games!
