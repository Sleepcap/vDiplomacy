<p>The only difference between Standard and Layered Diplomacy is the gameboard. Layered Diplomacy is played on two standard Diplomacy maps stacked in two layers, one on top of the other. So, in addition to the normal two dimensional movement, there is a third dimension.</p>

<p>The two layers are labeled <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> for simplicity and all territories are refered to in the same way with the addition of a <b>1</b> or <b>2</b> to the end of the name. Thus, there exists a <b>Munich 1</b> and a <b>Munich 2</b>. In order to provide smooth game play, there are a few unique aspects to Layered Diplomacy:</P>

<p><b>1)</b> All boundaries remain the same for each territory, except there is exactly <b>ONE</b> more adjacent area either above or below. Support is given in the same way and you can support a unit from one board to the other using the same algorithm as in normal Diplomacy. You may also convoy between boards. The key thing to remember is that each territory has only one adjacent territory on the other board and that adjacent territory only differs by the number found at the end of it.</p>

<p><b>2)</b> Each player plays the same power on each board.</p>

<p><b>3)</b> Units may be built on either board with no consideration given to which board the SCs where captured on, but can still only be built in an unoccupied home centers.</p>

<p><b>4)</b> Victory conditions are 35 SCs.</p>
