vDiplomacyTest
======

This is a fork of [vDiplomacy](https://github.com/Sleepcap/vDiplomacy) by Oliver Auth, which in turn is a fork of [webDiplomacy](https://github.com/kestasjk/webDiplomacy) by Kestas Kuliukis.  The purpose of this fork is to provide users with a venue where they are allowed to create multiple accounts to test their strategies.  This could also be useful for people who wish to use vDiplomacy to adjudicate games played at parties or teachers who wish to use Diplomacy games as a teaching device. [jDip](http://jdip.sourceforge.net/) could also be used for this purpose; however, jDip lacks many of the variants that are available for vDiplomacy.  The main differences between this fork and vDiplomacy are:

- no e-mail requirement
- anti-bot validation using [Are You a Human](http://areyouahuman.com/) instead of EasyCaptcha

The official server for vDiplomacyTest is http://www.liquidmarkets.com/vDiplomacyTest
