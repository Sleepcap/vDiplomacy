<p>Black Death Rule: All owned territories will have a unit at the start of the game, regardless of whether or not it has a supply center. This is to simulate the impact of the bubonic plague during this time period.</p>
<p>Build Anywhere Rule: Sometimes referred to as 'Chaos Builds', this variant allows each faction to build an army or fleet on any owned supply center that is unoccupied in the adjustments (a.k.a. 'Build') phases.</p>
<p>Cities Rule: On the map, the boxes with numbers are called 'Cities' and are supply centers that start with a unit, either neutral or controlled. Neutral units will always be ordered to hold. The Cities are: Jerusalem (1), Moscow (2), Baghdad (3), Samarkand (4), Khotum (5), Khanadar (6), Almalik (7), Lhasar (8), Si-Ning-Fu (9), Karakorum (10), Lo-Yang (11), Kainan (12), Angkor (13), and Yedo (14).</p>
<p>Trade Winds Rule: Any Fleet along the Trade Winds is able to move through an extra territory along the route, regardless of the placement of other fleets along the winds. For example, a Caliphate fleet in Red Sea may move to Maldives in one turn, even if there is a Delhi fleet in Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Silk Road Rule: Any army on the path of the Silk Road is able to move through an extra territory along the route (E. Byzantium to NW, Cumanis, Bargul, Sanchi), regardless of the placement of other armies along the road. For example, Yuan army in Sanchi may move to Naiman in one turn, even if there is a Chagati army in Carazan.</p>
<p>River Rule: All territories along a river are considered coastal. The river prohibits movement of either an army or a fleet over it unless there is a bridge. For example, a Great Khan army in North Cathay may move to Curguth or South Cathay, but not to Serra.</p>
<p>Mountains and Walls: Even the Mongols were stopped by the Great Wall of China, and countless other tribes were stopped by the Himalayas. The Great Wall runs along the Yuan Dynasty's northern and western borders, and can be considered a mountain range. Units may only cross a mountain range by going around it or by using a pass. For example, armies are permitted to move through the mountain ranges from Peking to Kilango and Bhutan to Nyingchi.</p>
<p>Intersections: Bulgar and Bashkir do not border each other, and Cumanis doesn't border Novo. Malwa and Bengali Sea also do not border each other, but Chola DOES border Bengal
