<p><b>Diplomacy Bidding Start:</b><br>
Each nation starts with their capital city and four tokens to bid for other home centers with. All of the
players reveal their bids at once for the biding phase. If a player is the only player to have bid on a supply center then that
supply center becomes a home center of that player. If two players bid on the same supply center the player who bid the
most on the supply center gets it as their home center. If they bid the same amount on the supply center then the supply
center remains neutral. After bidding there is <u>no</u> build phase. All Supply Centers that become a nation's Home Centers will
have either a navy or army in the territory. See the following table for a complete overview:
